//! Bond responses and chunk loads within a substep depend only on the state at the
//! start of the substep, so they are computed in parallel into a list in item order and
//! then applied sequentially in that order. Results (and every floating-point sum taken
//! from them) are therefore bit-identical for any thread count. The worker pool is
//! rayon's (`RAYON_NUM_THREADS` sets its size); with a single worker every loop runs on
//! the calling thread (handing work to the pool and waiting for it only costs time).
